# Animation support in Syncfusion Angular Components

The **Animation** is used to perform animation effects on HTML elements by running a sequence of frames. It can be used to enhance the user experience.

Syncfusion [Animation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/animation/) library supports animating the HTML elements using the [animate](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/animation/#animate) method. This method adds the `e-animate`, `e-animation-id` attributes, and CSS style to the HTML element and removes them after the animation effect is completed.

## Animation effects

An animation effect refers to the visual change that occurs over a period of time in HTML elements. The [Animation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/animation/) library supports different types of animation [effects](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/effect/#effect). The [name](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/animation/#name) property is used to specify the animation effect of an animation.

Here is an example code snippet using the `FadeOut` and `ZoomOut` animation effects:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/animation-multiple-cs1/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/animation-multiple-cs1/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/animation-multiple-cs1/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/samples/common/animation-multiple-cs1" %}

## Animation duration

Animation [duration](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/animation/#duration) is the animation property that specifies the length of time that an animation should take to complete. The animation duration is specified in milliseconds (ms) and determines the total amount of time that an animation should run.

For example, if an animation has a duration of 2 seconds, it will take 2 seconds to complete from start to finish. The duration of an animation affects the overall pace of the animation and can be adjusted to match the desired speed and style of the animation.

The value of the animation duration can be adjusted to change the speed of the animation, with shorter durations resulting in faster animations and longer durations resulting in slower animations.

Here is an example code snippet using the animation effects with a duration of `5000` milliseconds:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/animation-multiple-cs2/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/animation-multiple-cs2/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/animation-multiple-cs2/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/samples/common/animation-multiple-cs2" %}

## Animation delay

The animation [delay](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/animation/#delay) is the animation property that specifies the amount of time to wait before starting an animation. The animation delay is specified in milliseconds (ms) and determines the amount of time that should elapse before an animation begins.

For example, if an animation has a delay of 2 seconds, it will wait for 2 seconds before starting. This can be useful in creating more complex animations, where multiple elements are animated in sequence, or in creating animations that start only after a user interaction has taken place.

Here is an example code snippet using the animation effects with a delay of `2000` milliseconds:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/animation-multiple-cs3/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/animation-multiple-cs3/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/animation-multiple-cs3/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/samples/common/animation-multiple-cs3" %}
