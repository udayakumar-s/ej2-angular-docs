## Add a form field to PDF document programmatically

Using addFormField method, the form fields can be added to the PDF document programmatically. We need to pass two parameters in this method. They are Form Field Type and Properties of Form Field Type. To add form field programmatically, Use the following code.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/addformfield-cs2/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/addformfield-cs2/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/addformfield-cs2/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/pdfviewer/addformfield-cs2" %}

## Edit/Update form field programmatically

Using updateFormField method, Form Field can be updated programmatically. We should get the Form Field object/Id from FormFieldCollections property that you would like to edit and pass it as a parameter to updateFormField method. The second parameter should be the properties that you would like to update for Form Field programmatically. We have updated the value and background Color properties of Textbox Form Field.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/updateformfield-cs2/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/updateformfield-cs2/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/updateformfield-cs2/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/pdfviewer/updateformfield-cs2" %}

## Delete form field programmatically

Using deleteFormField method, the form field can be deleted programmatically. We should retrieve the Form Field object/Id from FormFieldCollections property that you would like to delete and pass it as a parameter to deleteFormField method. To delete a Form Field programmatically, use the following code.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/deleteformfield-cs2/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/deleteformfield-cs2/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/deleteformfield-cs2/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/pdfviewer/deleteformfield-cs2" %}
