# Add the custom stamp based on the free text bounds

To add a custom stamp in the Syncfusion PDF viewer based on the free text bounds, obtain the value of the bound for the free text in the Pixel in the **annotationAdd** event while adding the free text. However, when a custom stamp is added programmatically, the offset values are set in points. So, you must convert the value of the bound for the free text into a point to add the custom stamp to the free text bounds position.

Here is an example of how you can add the custom stamp based on the free text bounds:

```typescript

  public annotationAdd(args) {
    if (args.annotationType === 'FreeText') {
      this.x = (args.annotationBound.left * 72) / 96;
      this.y = (args.annotationBound.top * 72) / 96;
      console.log(args);
    }
  }

```
