# Load accordion with data source in Angular Accordion component

You can bind any data object to Accordion items, by mapping it to [`header`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionItem#header)
and [`content`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionItem#content)&nbsp; property.

In the below demo, Data is fetched from an `OData` service using `DataManager`. The result data is formatted as a
JSON object with [`header`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionItem#header) and [`content`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionItem#content)
fields, which is set to [`items`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion#items) property of Accordion.
