# Setting header of panels in Angular Dashboard layout component

The dashboard layout component is mostly used to represent the data used for monitoring or managing a process. These data or any HTML template can be placed as the content of a panel using the `content` property. Also, word or phrase that summarize the panelâ€™s content can be added as the header on the top of each panel using the `header` property of the panel.

The following sample demonstrates how to add content for each panel using the header and content properties of the panels.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-and-content-of-panels-cs1/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-and-content-of-panels-cs1/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-and-content-of-panels-cs1/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Placing components as content of panels

In a dashboard, components like the chart, grids, maps, gauge and more . can be used to present a complex data. Such components can be placed as the panel content by assigning the corresponding component element as the `content` of the panel.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/components-as-content-of-panels-cs1/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/components-as-content-of-panels-cs1/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/components-as-content-of-panels-cs1/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
