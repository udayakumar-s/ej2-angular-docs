# Node editing in Angular Treeview component

The TreeView allows you to edit nodes by setting the [allowEditing](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treeview#allowediting)
property to **true**.
To directly edit the nodes in place, **double click** the TreeView node or **select** the node and press **F2** key.

When editing is completed by focus out or by pressing the **Enter** key, the modified node’s text saves automatically.
If you do not want to save the modified node’s text in TreeView node, press **Escape** key. It does not save the edited text to
the TreeView node.

* Node editing can also be performed programmatically by using the
[`beginEdit`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treeview#beginedit) method. On passing the node ID or element
through this method, the edit textbox will be created for the particular node thus allowing us to
edit it.

* If you need to validate or prevent editing, the [`nodeEditing`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treeview#nodeediting)
event can be used which is triggered before the TreeView node is renamed. On successfully renaming
a node the [`nodeEdited`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treeview#nodeedited) event will be triggered.

In the following example, the first level node’s text cannot be changed, but all other level nodes' text can be changed.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
