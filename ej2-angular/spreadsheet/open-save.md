# Open save in Angular Spreadsheet component

In import an excel file, it needs to be read and converted to client side Spreadsheet model. The converted client side Spreadsheet model is sent as JSON which is used to render Spreadsheet. Similarly, when you save the Spreadsheet, the client Spreadsheet model is sent to the server as JSON for processing and saved. Server configuration is used for this process.

## Open

The Spreadsheet control opens an Excel document with its data, style, format, and more. To enable this feature, set [`allowOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#allowopen) as `true` and assign service url to the [`openUrl`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#openurl) property.

**User Interface**:

In user interface you can open an Excel document by clicking `File > Open` menu item in ribbon.

The following sample shows the `Open` option by using the [`openUrl`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#openurl) property in the Spreadsheet control. You can also use the [`beforeOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#beforeopen) event to trigger before opening an Excel file.

{% tabs %}

{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/open-save-cs1/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}

{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/open-save-cs1/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Please find the below table for the beforeOpen event arguments.

 | **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| file | FileList or string or File | To get the file stream. `FileList` -  contains length and item index. <br/> `File` - specifies the file lastModified and file name. |
| cancel | boolean | To prevent the open operation. |
| requestData | object |  To provide the Form data. |

> * Use `Ctrl + O` keyboard shortcut to open Excel documents.
> * The default value of the [allowOpen](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#allowopen) property is `true`. For demonstration purpose, we have showcased the [allowOpen](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#allowopen) property in previous code snippet.

### Open an external URL excel file while initial load

You can achieve to access the remote excel file by using the [`created`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#created) event. In this event you can fetch the excel file and convert it to a blob. Convert this blob to a file and [`open`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#open) this file by using Spreadsheet component open method.

### To add custom header during open

You can add your own custom header to the open action in the Spreadsheet. For processing the data, it has to be sent from server to client side and adding customer header can provide privacy to the data with the help of Authorization Token. Through the [`beforeOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#beforeopen) event, the custom header can be added to the request during open action.

## Server Configuration

In Spreadsheet control, Excel import and export support processed in `server-side`, to use importing and exporting in your projects, it is required to create a server with any of the following web services.

* WebAPI
* WCF Service
* ASP.NET MVC Controller Action

The following code snippets shows server configuration using `WebAPI` service,

```csharp

    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class SpreadsheetController : Controller
    {
        //To open excel file
        [AcceptVerbs("Post")]
        [HttpPost]
        [EnableCors("AllowAllOrigins")]
        [Route("Open")]
        public IActionResult Open(IFormCollection openRequest)
        {
            OpenRequest open = new OpenRequest();
            open.File = openRequest.Files[0];
            return Content(Workbook.Open(open));
        }

        //To save as excel file
        [AcceptVerbs("Post")]
        [HttpPost]
        [EnableCors("AllowAllOrigins")]
        [Route("Save")]
        public IActionResult Save(SaveSettings saveSettings)
        {
            return Workbook.Save(saveSettings);
        }
    }
```
